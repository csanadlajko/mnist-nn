"# mnist-nn" 

The project will contain two different solutions for number recognition using the MNIST dataset. In the first project, I'm going to build the neural network with the help of several python modules, designed for building an artificial neural network. Nevertheless, in my second project, I'm going to try to drop these modules and build the whole ANN from scratch.
