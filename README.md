The project will contain two different solutions for number recognition using the MNIST dataset:
 - In the first project, I'm going to build the neural network with the help of several python modules, designed for building an artificial neural network. 
 - Nevertheless, in my second project, I'm going to try and drop these modules and build the whole ANN from scratch.

Additionally, as a warm up/practice, I've implemented an ANN for the XOR function, only using NumPy.

The firstProject folder has the solution where I used torch library to build the network.
The secondProject folder will contain the final product, an ANN built from scratch, trained and tested on the MNIST dataset.
This folder already contains an implementation for a XOR ANN, as mentioned above in the document.

I aim to provide thorough documentation throughout the code to make the implementation as clear and understandable as possible.
